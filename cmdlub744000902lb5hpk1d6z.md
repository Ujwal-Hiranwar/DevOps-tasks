I personally feel spring boot is really a great choice that I made in my early days of Engineering. because, at that time everyone was selecting a framework (for backend) like NestJS, Django, Laravel, Ruby on Rails etc.

The thing is I came from Java background so I decided to go with Spring Boot, There is a lot of things to learn in spring boot I repeat a lot. Initially I learned about spring MVC, Spring REST, Spring Cloud, spring data JPA, Spring Security (I don’t know them completely yet).

Features that I liked about Spring Boot are :

**Spring Data JPA**: Simplifies interaction with relational databases using Java Persistence API (JPA). Provides powerful abstractions like `CrudRepository` and `JPARepository`. Automatically implements queries based on ready made method names.

**Spring REST:** Spring REST is a part of Spring Web that helps build RESTful web services. It uses annotations like @RestController, @GetMapping, and @PostMapping to expose HTTP endpoints.

**Spring Security:** Handles authentication and authorization for applications. Supports security standards like JWT, OAuth2, and LDAP. Can secure web endpoints, REST APIs, and method calls.

**Spring Cloud:** A set of tools to build cloud-native, distributed microservices. Includes service discovery, config management, gateway, and tracing. Works well with Kubernetes and cloud platforms. The support of Eureka was good but very few people use it now.

It’s one of the most mature framework, It does not get regular updates all the dependences are mostly stable, It have a support of lots of plugins. Wow!! what else do you want. This framework is mostly focused on microservices architecture, Many companies work on this framework due to it’s stability like Netflix. Believe me it’s hard to love Spring Boot until you see and understand it’s beauty.

Initially I thought that I took a dumb decision but believe me after learning a lot of things about Spring Boot, I will say Spring boot is really good though!!!
